# set-plugin-version.sh — set the plugin package version across every plugin in
# this repo.
#
# Updates the "version" field in each plugin manifest (.claude-plugin/plugin.json
# and .codex-plugin/plugin.json) and the "Version **x.y.z**" line in each
# plugin README, for the dev-*, sql-* and contributor-* plugins across claude/,
# codex/, opencode/ and pi/, plus the repo-root package.json.
#
# Not every plugin carries both: OpenCode has no manifest version field, so only
# its README is updated, and pi has no per-plugin manifest at all — the repo-root
# package.json IS its manifest, which is why that file is in the list.
# (CHANGELOG history is intentionally left untouched.)
#
# This is the plugin *package* version, NOT the mariadb-shell binary version —
# use scripts/set-mariadb-shell-version.sh for the latter.

#   scripts/set-plugin-version.sh 26.8.1

set-plugin-version.sh — set the plugin package version across every plugin in
this repo.

Usage:
  scripts/set-plugin-version.sh <version>
  scripts/set-plugin-version.sh --help

Arguments:
  <version>   The plugin package version to set, e.g. 26.8.1.

Updates, for the dev-*, sql-* and contributor-* plugins across claude/, codex/,
opencode/ and pi/:
  - the "version" field in each plugin manifest (.claude-plugin/plugin.json,
    .codex-plugin/plugin.json)
  - the "Version **x.y.z**" line in each plugin README
  - the repo-root package.json

Not every plugin carries both: OpenCode has no manifest version field, so only
its README is updated, and pi has no per-plugin manifest at all — the repo-root
package.json IS its manifest. CHANGELOG history is intentionally left untouched.

This is the plugin *package* version, NOT the mariadb-shell binary version —
use scripts/set-mariadb-shell-version.sh for the latter.
