# mariadb-mcp-launcher.sh — resolve (installing if needed) and launch the
# mariadb-shell native MCP server.
#
# Resolution order:
#   1. $MARIADB_SHELL_BIN, if set (explicit override).
#   2. A mariadb-shell found on $PATH whose version is >= MARIADB_SHELL_VERSION.
#   3. A local install at $MARIADB_SHELL_BINDIR/mariadb-shell (default
#      ~/.local/bin/mariadb-shell) at that version or newer.
#   4. Otherwise fetch the official installer, install.sh, from a pinned
#      mariadb-shell commit and install release v$MARIADB_SHELL_VERSION — the one
#      this plugin release was tested with, prerelease or not — into
#      ~/.local/share/mariadb-shell/<version>, linked into ~/.local/bin; then
#      launch what it installed.
#
# Step 4 is serialized: launchers started together (several sessions, or the
# MCP and another harness at once) take turns through a lock folder in the
# install prefix, and wait for an install.sh that is already running there. The
# one that waited looks again before installing, since the install it waited
# for has usually put a good enough shell in place.
#
# Installing is delegated to install.sh rather than reimplemented here: it picks
# the package matching the local OS, CPU and glibc version and verifies its
# checksum. The checksums come from mariadb-shell-<tag>.SHA256SUMS next to this
# script, a copy of that release's SHA256SUMS committed with the plugin, so a
# package replaced on the release after the fact is refused. Nothing in this
# launcher needs to know how release assets are named.
#
# This copy is Hermes' own: the other harnesses' launchers install the newest
# release from the installer on main.
#
# However it is resolved, the binary is exec'd as
#   mariadb-shell -- mcp start-server --transport=stdio
# so the MCP server runs over stdio (not HTTP). stdout therefore belongs to the
# MCP transport alone: every message from this script, and from the installer it
# runs, goes to stderr instead. The MCP config just points at this launcher with
# no extra arguments.
#
# Environment:
#   MARIADB_SHELL_VERSION     Minimum acceptable version (default below). A PATH
#                             or locally installed binary is accepted when equal
#                             or higher; anything lower triggers an install of
#                             release v<this version>.
#   MARIADB_SHELL_BIN         Path to a pre-installed binary; skips all other logic.
#   MARIADB_SHELL_BINDIR      Where install.sh links the binary (default ~/.local/bin);
#                             this is also where step 3 looks.
#   MARIADB_SHELL_PREFIX      Passed through: where install.sh unpacks releases
#                             (default ~/.local/share/mariadb-shell). The
#                             launchers' lock folder, .mcp-launcher.lock, is there.
#   MARIADB_SHELL_LOCK_WAIT   Seconds to wait for another install to finish
#                             (default 180) before giving up on installing.
#   MARIADB_SHELL_TAG         Release tag to install (default v$MARIADB_SHELL_VERSION).
#                             A tag with no committed SHA256SUMS next to this
#                             script is checked against the release's own.
#   MARIADB_SHELL_REPO        Passed through: owner/repo to install from.
