# Plugin Variants

MariaDB AI Plugins are available in three variants. They differ in the skills they include and in whether they include the MCP server. All variants are built from the same sources.

| Variant | Skills | MCP server |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dev` | All skills, covering SQL statements, built-in functions, command-line tools, connectors, and general topics, plus all [additional skills](skills-reference/additional-skills.md) of the repository. | Yes |
| `sql` | A subset for SQL development, covering SQL statements, built-in functions, and general topics, plus the repository's skill for SQL scripts. | Yes |
| `contributor` | Skills for developing MariaDB Shell and its plugins, taken from the MariaDB Shell repository. | No |

In most cases, install the `dev` plugin.

## Availability by Harness

| Harness | `dev` | `sql` | `contributor` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Codex | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| OpenCode | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Pi | Yes | No | No |

## Skill Counts

| Variant | Skills |
| --- | --- |

The [Skills Reference](skills-reference/) lists every skill and the variants that ship it.

## Directory Layout

In the repository, each variant lives in `<harness>/<variant>-plugin/`, for example `claude/dev-plugin/` or `codex/sql-plugin/`. Pi's plugin lives in `pi/dev-plugin/`, with the repository-root `package.json` as its manifest.
