  Example requests for AI coding agents with MariaDB AI Plugins, with and
  without a database connection.

# Basic Usage

You don't call skills or MCP tools yourself. Instead, you describe your task to the agent, and the agent decides which skills to read and which tools to use. The following examples show typical requests.

## With Skills Alone

The following requests don't require a database connection:

* *Write a `CREATE TABLE` for a product catalog, MariaDB style.*
* *What changes if I move this application from MySQL to MariaDB?*
* *How do I do semantic search in MariaDB?*
* *Show me how to connect to MariaDB from Node.js.*

## With the MCP Server Connected

The following requests work with a database that you configured with `mcp setup`:

* *What does the schema of my `orders` table look like?*
* *Why is this query slow? Run `EXPLAIN` on it.*
* *Which of my tables have no primary key?*
* *Deploy a test instance and try this migration on it first.*

## With a Sandbox Instance

If you don't have a database, the agent can deploy a local MariaDB Server instance for testing:

* *Deploy a MariaDB sandbox on port 3310.*
* *Spin up a test instance, apply this schema to it, and show me the result.*
* *Try this migration on a sandbox before I run it for real.*
* *Stop and delete the sandbox, I'm done with it.*

See [Sandbox Instances](features/sandbox-instances.md).

## A Complete Example

The following request uses both the skills and the MCP server. The agent designs the schema with the help of the skills, and uses the MCP tools to deploy a server and run the script:

```
Create a MariaDB database schema for a note-taking app and store it in
notes_app.sql. Then spin up a sandbox instance on port 3310, connect to it,
and run the script. Finally, list the tables you created.
```

To complete the request, the agent calls `sandbox.deploy`, then `db.connect` with the connection that the sandbox registered, then `db.execute_sql_script` with the file, and finally `db.list_objects`. The directory that contains `notes_app.sql` must be on the [allowed-paths list](configuring-the-mcp-server/README.md#allowed-paths).

## Using MariaDB Shell Yourself

You can also use MariaDB Shell directly as a SQL client. Start it with `mariadb-shell`, and enter `\help` for a list of commands. MariaDB Shell can also access the sandbox instances that the agent creates.
