# MCP Tool Reference

The `mariadb-shell` MCP server provides 28 tools in three groups. A fourth, optional group is available when the migration tooling is installed.

| Group | Tools | What they do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`db.*`](db-tools.md) | 8 | List connections and schemas, describe objects, and run SQL. |
| [`msm.*`](msm-tools.md) | 12 | Versioned schema projects, releases, and deployments with MariaDB Schema Management. |
| [`sandbox.*`](sandbox-tools.md) | 8 | List deployable server versions; deploy, start, stop, and delete local instances. |
| [`migrator.*`](migrator-tools.md) | 4 | MySQL-to-MariaDB migration. Optional, and not counted in the 28. |

A server in multi-tenant mode (the `--multiTenant` option of `mcp setup`, available in MariaDB Shell 26.10.0 and later) serves only the `db.*` and `msm.*` groups. The `sandbox.*` and `migrator.*` tools run local server instances and long-running jobs on the machine that hosts the MCP server, and aren't offered to tenants. The server that the plugins' launcher scripts start is single-tenant and serves every group.

## Conventions

* Arguments are named as the tools take them.
* `connection_id` always comes from a prior `db.connect` call.
* Any argument that takes a file path is limited to the allowed-paths list. See [Security Model](../security-model.md#paths).
