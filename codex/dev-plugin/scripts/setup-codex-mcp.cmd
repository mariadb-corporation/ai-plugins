rem setup-codex-mcp.cmd -- register the mariadb-shell MCP server with Codex,
rem                        on native Windows. The counterpart of
rem                        setup-codex-mcp.sh.
rem
rem Installing this plugin gives Codex the MariaDB *skills*. The MCP server needs
rem this one extra step, because of how Codex 0.147 treats a plugin's .mcp.json:
rem it stores the `command` verbatim and expands nothing, so the
rem ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} placeholder a plugin has to use (it cannot know the
rem content-addressed directory Codex will install it into) is exec'd literally
rem and the server dies with "MCP startup failed: No such file or directory".
rem
rem `codex mcp add` writes an ordinary [mcp_servers.mariadb] entry into
rem %CODEX_HOME%\config.toml with the absolute path resolved here, which does
rem work -- and it takes precedence over the plugin-provided entry of the same
rem name.
rem
rem This registers the **.cmd** launcher, which is the point of having a separate
rem script: Codex spawns the command directly, so a .sh path -- what the bash
rem version writes, even when run from Git Bash -- is not executable on native
rem Windows.
rem
rem Usage:
rem   codex\dev-plugin\scripts\setup-codex-mcp.cmd            register (or update)
rem   codex\dev-plugin\scripts\setup-codex-mcp.cmd --remove   unregister
rem
rem Environment:
rem   CODEX_HOME              Codex config dir to write to (default %USERPROFILE%\.codex).
rem   CODEX_BIN               codex binary to use (default: the one on PATH).
rem   MARIADB_SHELL_VERSION   Minimum mariadb-shell version to pass to the launcher.
