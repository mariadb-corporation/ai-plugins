# mariadb-mcp-launcher.sh — resolve (installing if needed) and launch the
# mariadb-shell native MCP server.
#
# Resolution order:
#   1. $MARIADB_SHELL_BIN, if set (explicit override).
#   2. A mariadb-shell found on $PATH whose version is >= MARIADB_SHELL_VERSION.
#   3. A local install at $MARIADB_SHELL_BINDIR/mariadb-shell (default
#      ~/.local/bin/mariadb-shell) at that version or newer.
#   4. Otherwise fetch and run the official installer,
#      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mariadb-corporation/mariadb-shell/main/install.sh,
#      which unpacks the newest release into ~/.local/share/mariadb-shell/<version>
#      and links it into ~/.local/bin — then launch what it installed.
#
# Installing is delegated to install.sh rather than reimplemented here: it picks
# the package matching the local OS, CPU and glibc version, reads the asset list
# from the release's own SHA256SUMS and verifies the checksum. Nothing in this
# launcher needs to know how release assets are named.
#
# However it is resolved, the binary is exec'd as
#   mariadb-shell -- mcp start-server --transport=stdio
# so the MCP server runs over stdio (not HTTP). stdout therefore belongs to the
# MCP transport alone: every message from this script, and from the installer it
# runs, goes to stderr instead. The MCP config just points at this launcher with
# no extra arguments.
#
# Environment:
#   MARIADB_SHELL_VERSION     Minimum acceptable version (default below). A PATH
#                             or locally installed binary is accepted when equal
#                             or higher; anything lower triggers an install of
#                             the newest release.
#   MARIADB_SHELL_BIN         Path to a pre-installed binary; skips all other logic.
#   MARIADB_SHELL_BINDIR      Where install.sh links the binary (default ~/.local/bin);
#                             this is also where step 3 looks.
#   MARIADB_SHELL_PREFIX      Passed through: where install.sh unpacks releases.
#   MARIADB_SHELL_TAG         Passed through: install this release tag rather than
#                             the newest.
#   MARIADB_SHELL_PRERELEASE  Normally unset: a stable release is preferred, and a
#                             prerelease is installed only when there is no stable
#                             one to install. Set to 1 to go straight for a
#                             prerelease, or to 0 to refuse one entirely.
#   MARIADB_SHELL_REPO        Passed through: owner/repo to install from.
#   MARIADB_SHELL_TOKEN       Token for a private repository. GH_TOKEN and
#                             GITHUB_TOKEN are consulted too, then `gh auth token`
#                             — the same order install.sh itself uses.
