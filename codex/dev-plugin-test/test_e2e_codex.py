"""Tier 4 — end-to-end via the real Codex CLI (opt-in: `pytest -m e2e`).

The Codex counterpart of `claude/dev-plugin-tests/test_e2e_claude.py`: it drives
the actual `codex` binary with this plugin installed and its mariadb-shell MCP
server wired in, then proves the whole stack worked by its side effects. The one
expensive `codex exec` happens in the module-scoped `workflow` fixture; every
side effect below is a separate `test_stepN_*` so it is reported and can be run
alone (`pytest -k step3`). The steps:

  1. `notes-app.sql` is written and opens with the *Start Block* mandated by the
     `mariadb-schema-create-script` skill → the plugin's skills reached the model.
  2. A MariaDB sandbox is reachable          → the MCP `sandbox.deploy` tool ran.
  3. The `notes-app` schema exists in it     → SQL ran through the MCP server.
  4. `notes-app-rest.sql` carries the REST DDL for `/notesApp` → the
     `mariadb-rest-service-create` skill was loaded and followed.
  5. The REST metadata schema reports the `/notesApp` service and its objects →
     the REST script really was executed against the sandbox.
  6. The event stream shows completed **MCP tool calls on the `mariadb` server**,
     and the launcher probe fired → the server was not merely configured but
     used, and it was *this plugin's* launcher that Codex spawned.

Two further tests stand apart from the workflow because they cost no model
tokens: they check that Codex *registers* the server correctly when the plugin is
installed the way a user installs it (see the module docstring of
`lib/codex_cli.py` for why marketplace discovery is the interesting part).

Deselected by default (see pyproject.toml `addopts`). It self-skips unless the
whole toolchain is present: the `codex` CLI (override: CODEX_BIN) already
authenticated (`codex login`), a `mariadb-shell` the launcher can resolve (on
PATH or via MARIADB_SHELL_BIN), and PyMySQL to inspect the sandbox.

Knobs (all optional): CODEX_BIN, E2E_MODEL, E2E_TIMEOUT, E2E_SANDBOX_HOST,
E2E_SANDBOX_PORT, E2E_SANDBOX_USER, E2E_SANDBOX_PASSWORD.
