"""Tier 2 — the connection `sandbox.deploy` registers, and `db.connect` on it.

This covers the one path an agent actually takes and that nothing else here
exercised. Every other tier reaches the database with credentials it was already
given: the rest of the db tier connects with PyMySQL straight from
``instance.dsn``, and the e2e modules pass host/port/user/password on each SQL
tool call or hand the model the password in the prompt. So a green suite proved a
sandbox was *running*, never that an agent could reach it the way the README
promises — deploy an instance, then connect with no credentials at all.

What makes that work is a chain of three things in the shell's ``mcp_plugin``,
none of which is obvious from the outside:

* ``sandbox.deploy`` calls ``config.store_connection("root@127.0.0.1:<port>",
  password)``, whose only effect is to write that password into the shell's
  secret store.
* ``db.list_connections`` is *derived from those secrets* — it lists the URIs
  that have a stored password, rather than a connection registry of its own.
* ``db.connect`` checks its argument against that same list and refuses anything
  absent from it with "is not a configured connection".

So the registration is only visible through the config home that holds the secret
store — hence ``sandbox.mcp_client``, which reuses the instance's — and an
unreadable secret store makes *every* connection look unconfigured. That last
failure mode is not hypothetical: on Windows over SSH the credential helper is
unavailable and ``db.list_connections`` fails outright, which reads exactly like
a deploy that never registered anything.

The URI no longer has to be spelled the way it is stored: ``db.connect`` now
normalizes a scheme prefix, host case, the default port and an inline password,
while keeping anything the configured connection does not name — a default
schema, a connection option — significant. Both halves are pinned below, because
each protects something: the first that a client composing its own URI is
understood, the second that ``ssl-mode=REQUIRED`` cannot be silently dropped by
answering with the plain connection instead.
