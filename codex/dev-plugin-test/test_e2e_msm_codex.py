"""Tier 4 — end-to-end for the MSM skills via the real Codex CLI
(opt-in: `pytest -m e2e`).

The Codex counterpart of `claude/dev-plugin-tests/test_e2e_msm_claude.py`. Unlike
the REST e2e module there is **no database and no sandbox**: `msm.prepare_release`
and `msm.generate_deployment_script` are pure on-disk operations, so every check
below is a file. Codex is driven through two releases (v1.0.0 → develop →
v1.1.0), and the assertions are about the *shape* of what MSM produced:

  1. the project was scaffolded with a development script,
  2. v1.0.0 put tables in the non-idempotent create section (140) and the VIEW in
     the idempotent one (150),
  3. the 1.0.0 deployment script was generated,
  4. the 1.0.0→1.1.0 **update script was filled** — new tables in 240, the new
     VIEW in 250. SQL comments are stripped first so the empty template's ToDo
     prose cannot satisfy the assertion,
  5. the v1.1.0 deployment script composes every object from both releases,
  6. Codex registered, started and called this plugin's MariaDB MCP server (a
     completed call in the event stream, and the launcher probe fired), and
  7. it used the `msm.*` MCP tools rather than the mariadb-shell CLI — a
     non-strict xfail, since the artifacts above are correct either way and the
     choice is the model's.

The one expensive `codex exec` runs in the module-scoped `workflow` fixture; each
step is a separate test (`pytest -k step4` still drives the one run).

Deselected by default (see pyproject.toml `addopts`); self-skips unless `codex`
(authenticated) and a resolvable `mariadb-shell` are present.

Knobs (all optional): CODEX_BIN, E2E_MODEL, E2E_TIMEOUT.
