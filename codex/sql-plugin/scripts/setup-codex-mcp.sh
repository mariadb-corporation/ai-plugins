# setup-codex-mcp.sh — register the mariadb-shell MCP server with Codex.
#
# Installing this plugin gives Codex the MariaDB *skills*. The MCP server needs
# this one extra step, because of how Codex 0.147 treats a plugin's .mcp.json:
# it stores the `command` verbatim and expands nothing, so the
# ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} placeholder a plugin has to use (it cannot know the
# content-addressed directory Codex will install it into) is exec'd literally and
# the server dies with "MCP startup failed: No such file or directory".
#
# `codex mcp add` writes an ordinary [mcp_servers.mariadb] entry into
# $CODEX_HOME/config.toml with the absolute path resolved here, which does work —
# and it takes precedence over the plugin-provided entry of the same name.
#
# On Windows use setup-codex-mcp.cmd instead, and not merely because this needs
# bash: the entry below names the .sh launcher, which Codex — which spawns the
# command directly — cannot execute on a native Windows host. The .cmd script
# registers the .cmd launcher.
#
# Usage:
#   codex/dev-plugin/scripts/setup-codex-mcp.sh              # register (or update)
#   codex/dev-plugin/scripts/setup-codex-mcp.sh --remove     # unregister
#
# Environment:
#   CODEX_HOME              Codex config dir to write to (default ~/.codex).
#   CODEX_BIN               codex binary to use (default: the one on PATH).
#   MARIADB_SHELL_VERSION   Minimum mariadb-shell version to pass to the launcher.
