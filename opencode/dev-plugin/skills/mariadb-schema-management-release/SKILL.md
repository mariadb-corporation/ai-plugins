description: "Prepare a MariaDB Schema Management (MSM) version release — snapshot the development script with msm.prepare_release, FILL the generated previous→new update script (sections 240/250/270) with the actual migration, and only then generate the deployment script with msm.generate_deployment_script. Use when cutting/preparing an MSM schema release or version, writing the release-to-release migration, or generating a deployment script. Read mariadb-schema-management first for the section model."

# MSM — Preparing a Version Release

This step turns the current development script into a released version and, for
any release after the first, produces the migration from the previous release.
See `mariadb-schema-management` for the section model. Assume MariaDB 11.8.

**The order is mandatory:**

```text
1. msm.prepare_release          → version snapshot (+ empty update script)
2. FILL the update script       → sections 240 / 250 / 270  ← do NOT skip
3. msm.generate_deployment_script  ← only after step 2
```

## 1. Prepare the release

```text
msm.prepare_release(version="1.1.0", next_version="1.2.0")
```

This:
- Inlines any `SOURCE` breakout files and writes the full snapshot
  `releases/versions/<schema>_1.1.0.sql`.
- If a previous release exists, creates an **empty** update script
  `releases/updates/<schema>_<prev>_to_1.1.0.sql` from the template.
- Bumps the development version in `_next.sql` to `next_version` (1.2.0).

Semver validation: `version` must be ≥ the last released version, and
`next_version` must be greater than `version` (unless
`allow_to_stay_on_same_version` is set). The **first** release has no update
script.

## 2. FILL the update script — the step everyone forgets

`prepare_release` only creates the update script; it does **not** know how to
migrate data/structure. You must write the migration from the previous release
to this one into its sections, using `msm.set_section_sql_content(file_path,
section_id, sql_content)`:

- **Section 240 — non-idempotent changes + all drops.** `ALTER TABLE`, new
  `CREATE TABLE`, data backfill (`UPDATE`/`INSERT`), and any `DROP` of objects
  that would block a table change. Order matters — these are largely
  irreversible. This becomes a stored-procedure body in the deployment script, so
  write plain `;`-terminated statements, **no `DELIMITER`**; use dynamic SQL
  (`PREPARE`/`EXECUTE`) for conditional DDL.

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE `notes-app`.`note` ADD COLUMN `created_at` DATETIME;
  UPDATE `notes-app`.`note` SET `created_at` = NOW() WHERE `created_at` IS NULL;
  ```

- **Section 250 — idempotent re-creation.** Re-create every VIEW / routine /
  trigger / event that changed, with `CREATE OR REPLACE` / `DROP IF EXISTS`.
  Top-level, uses `DELIMITER %%`.
- **Section 270 — authorization changes.** `GRANT` / `REVOKE` relative to the
  previous version (stored-procedure body → plain `;`, no `DELIMITER`).
- **Sections 230 / 290 — update helpers** (`msm_`-prefixed) if the migration
  needs temporary routines; drop them in 290.

Write the migration to match exactly what changed between the previous version
snapshot and this one. If a section has no changes, leave it empty.

## 3. Generate the deployment script

Only after the update script is filled:

```text
msm.generate_deployment_script(version="1.1.0")
    → releases/deployment/<schema>_deployment_1.1.0.sql
```

What it produces:
- For the **first** release, the deployment script is just the version snapshot.
- Otherwise it is a self-contained script that **either creates fresh or upgrades
  any prior released version** to the target: it builds `msm_create_<target>()`
  from section 140, an `msm_update_<from>_to_<to>()` from **each** update script's
  section 240, an `msm_create_or_update()` dispatcher that reads
  `msm_schema_version` and applies the right path, then the idempotent objects
  (150) and authorization (`msm_auth_*` from 170/270), and finally drops all
  `msm_` procedures and stamps the new version.

Because it embeds the update sections, generating **before** filling them yields
a script that can create fresh but cannot correctly upgrade older installs. Every
gap between consecutive released versions needs a filled update script for the
upgrade chain to be complete.

Deployment scripts are **generated artifacts** — never hand-edit; re-generate.

## Next

Deploy the release onto a server: `mariadb-schema-management-deploy`.
