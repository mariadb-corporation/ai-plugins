# MariaDB SQL plugin for OpenCode

Version **26.7.0**

This plugin gives [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) first-class MariaDB SQL support
through two parts:

1. **Skills** — MariaDB agent skills (SQL statements, functions, and topical
   deep-dives) vendored from
   [`mariadb-corporation/mariadb-docs/agent-skills`](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/mariadb-docs/tree/main/agent-skills),
   baseline **MariaDB 11.8 LTS**. They follow the open `SKILL.md` standard, so
   OpenCode loads them contextually and you can invoke them via `/skills`.
2. **A native MCP server** — the [`mariadb-shell`](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/mariadb-shell)
   binary, started automatically by a launcher that finds a suitable install or,
   failing that, runs the shell's own installer to get one.

## Installation

OpenCode has no central plugin marketplace; you wire the two parts into your
OpenCode config and skills directories. Clone this repo (or copy this
`sql-plugin/` directory) somewhere stable, then:

**1. Register the MCP server.** Merge the `mcp` block from this plugin's
[opencode.json](opencode.json) into your project `opencode.json` (or global
`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`), and point `MARIADB_SQL_PLUGIN` at this
directory:

```sh
export MARIADB_SQL_PLUGIN=/path/to/ai-plugins/opencode/sql-plugin
```

**2. Make the skills discoverable.** OpenCode loads skills one directory deep from
`.opencode/skills/`, `~/.config/opencode/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, and
`.agents/skills/`. Symlink (or copy) the flat `skills/` dir into one of those:

```sh
ln -s "$MARIADB_SQL_PLUGIN/skills" ~/.config/opencode/skills/mariadb
# …or per-project:
ln -s "$MARIADB_SQL_PLUGIN/skills" .opencode/skills/mariadb
```

On first use of a MariaDB tool, the launcher looks for a `mariadb-shell` it can
run — `$MARIADB_SHELL_BIN`, one on `PATH`, or an existing install in
`~/.local/bin` (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\mariadb-shell\bin` on Windows) — and
otherwise installs the newest release there with the shell's own installer. Then
it starts that binary as the MCP server. Later runs reuse the install.

## The MCP server

Configured in [opencode.json](opencode.json):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "mariadb": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["{env:MARIADB_SQL_PLUGIN}/scripts/mariadb-mcp-launcher.sh"],
      "environment": { "MARIADB_SHELL_VERSION": "26.8.0" },
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

OpenCode substitutes `{env:MARIADB_SQL_PLUGIN}` from the environment (its documented
variable-substitution syntax), so the launcher resolves regardless of where OpenCode
is started.

The launcher ([scripts/mariadb-mcp-launcher.sh](scripts/mariadb-mcp-launcher.sh)):

- Resolves the minimum version from `MARIADB_SHELL_VERSION` (default `26.8.0`).
- Runs the first `mariadb-shell` that meets it: `$MARIADB_SHELL_BIN`, then one on
  `PATH`, then a local install at `~/.local/bin/mariadb-shell`
  (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\mariadb-shell\bin\mariadb-shell.cmd` on Windows).
- Failing all three, runs the shell's own installer — `install.sh`, or
  `install.ps1` on Windows, fetched from
  `raw.githubusercontent.com/mariadb-corporation/mariadb-shell/main/`. It picks
  the package matching this OS, CPU and glibc version, verifies it against the
  release's `SHA256SUMS`, unpacks it under `~/.local/share/mariadb-shell/` and
  links the binary into `~/.local/bin`. Later starts reuse that install.
- Execs whichever binary it settled on as
  `mariadb-shell -- mcp start-server --transport=stdio`. stdout belongs to the
  MCP transport alone, so the launcher's own messages — and the installer's — go
  to stderr.

**Windows:** the `.sh` launcher works on macOS/Linux and under Git-Bash; native
Windows users should point the `command` at
[scripts/mariadb-mcp-launcher.cmd](scripts/mariadb-mcp-launcher.cmd).

**Private repository:** while `mariadb-shell` is private, set `GH_TOKEN` (or
`MARIADB_SHELL_TOKEN`, or simply run `gh auth login`). The token is needed twice:
to fetch the installer, and for the installer to download the release.

**Prereleases:** the installer skips prereleases, as `releases/latest` does. Set
`MARIADB_SHELL_PRERELEASE=1` to let it pick one — necessary until a stable
`mariadb-shell` release is published.

### Configure what the server may access

The skills work on their own. The MCP server, however, starts out allowed to reach
nothing — installing this plugin wires it up, but does not tell it what it may
touch. Run this once per machine:

```sh
mariadb-shell -- mcp setup     # or mcp.setup() from an interactive shell
```

If `mariadb-shell` isn't on your `PATH`, use the copy the launcher installed —
`~/.local/bin/mariadb-shell`, or
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\mariadb-shell\bin\mariadb-shell.cmd` on Windows. The
installer only prints a `PATH` hint; it never edits your shell profile. That copy
appears the first time this plugin starts the MCP server, so either let the agent
run once first, or install the shell yourself before configuring it.

## Skills

Skills are vendored under [skills/](skills/) in a **flat** layout — one directory
per skill, directly under `skills/` — because OpenCode discovers skills only one
directory deep. They are kept in sync across all plugins by the repo-wide updater
[scripts/sync-skills.sh](../../scripts/sync-skills.sh) (which flattens this target
automatically) — to refresh from upstream, run it from the repo root (it syncs
the latest upstream by default; pass a ref to sync a specific version); per-plugin
provenance is recorded in [skills-source.json](skills-source.json).

```text
skills/
├── statements   create-table, alter-table, select, insert, update, delete,
│                replace, create-view, create-index, drop-table,
│                create-database, load-data
├── functions    json, string, date-time, numeric, aggregate
└── topical      features, query-optimization, system-versioned-tables,
                 mysql-to-mariadb, vector
```
