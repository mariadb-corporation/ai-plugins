rem mariadb-mcp-launcher.cmd -- Windows launcher for the mariadb-shell MCP server.
rem
rem Resolution order:
rem   1. %MARIADB_SHELL_BIN%, if set (explicit override).
rem   2. A mariadb-shell on %PATH% whose version is >= MARIADB_SHELL_VERSION.
rem   3. A local install at %MARIADB_SHELL_BINDIR%\mariadb-shell.cmd (default
rem      %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\mariadb-shell\bin) at that version or newer.
rem   4. Otherwise fetch and run the official installer,
rem      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mariadb-corporation/mariadb-shell/main/install.ps1,
rem      which unpacks the newest release under %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\mariadb-shell
rem      and writes .cmd shims into its bin dir -- then launch what it installed.
rem
rem Installing is delegated to install.ps1 rather than reimplemented here: it
rem picks the package matching the local CPU, reads the asset list from the
rem release's own SHA256SUMS and verifies the checksum. Nothing in this launcher
rem needs to know how release assets are named.
rem
rem However it resolves, the binary is run as
rem   mariadb-shell -- mcp start-server --transport=stdio
rem so the MCP server runs over stdio (not HTTP). stdout therefore belongs to the
rem MCP transport alone: every message from this script, and from the installer
rem it runs, is redirected to stderr instead.
rem
rem Environment:
rem   MARIADB_SHELL_VERSION     Minimum acceptable version (default below).
rem   MARIADB_SHELL_BIN         Pre-installed binary; skips all other logic.
rem   MARIADB_SHELL_BINDIR      Where install.ps1 writes its shims, and where
rem                             step 3 looks.
rem   MARIADB_SHELL_PREFIX      Passed through: where install.ps1 unpacks releases.
rem   MARIADB_SHELL_TAG         Passed through: install this release tag.
rem   MARIADB_SHELL_PRERELEASE  Normally unset: a stable release is preferred, and
rem                             a prerelease installed only when there is no stable
rem                             one. Set to 1 to go straight for a prerelease, or
rem                             to 0 to refuse one entirely.
rem   MARIADB_SHELL_REPO        Passed through: owner/repo to install from.
rem   MARIADB_SHELL_TOKEN       Token for a private repository. GH_TOKEN and
rem                             GITHUB_TOKEN are consulted too, then
rem                             `gh auth token` -- install.ps1's own order.
