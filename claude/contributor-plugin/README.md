# MariaDB contributor plugin for Claude Code

Version **26.8.1**

Skills for **contributing to MariaDB tooling**. Unlike the `dev`/`sql` plugins
(which vendor the MariaDB SQL/usage skills from `mariadb-docs`), this plugin
vendors the skills kept in the
[`mariadb-corporation/mariadb-shell`](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/mariadb-shell)
repository under `.claude/skills/`. For now it ships **skills only** — no MCP
server.

> Note: `mariadb-shell` is currently a **private** repository. Vendoring its
> skills requires GitHub credentials (see below).

## Installation

```text
/plugin marketplace add mariadb/ai-plugins
/plugin install contributor@mariadb
```

## Skills

Skills are vendored flat under [skills/](skills/). They are kept in sync by the
repo-wide updater [scripts/sync-skills.sh](../../scripts/sync-skills.sh), which
fetches `mariadb-shell`'s `.claude/skills/` tree and copies each `SKILL.md` into
`skills/<skill>/`. Because the source repo is private, the sync authenticates
with `GH_TOKEN` (or `gh auth token`); without credentials it skips this plugin.
Per-plugin provenance is recorded in [skills-source.json](skills-source.json).

## License

Plugin code is **GPL-2.0** — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). The bundled skills are
vendored from several source repositories and retain their original licenses;
see [additional-skills/README.md](../../additional-skills/README.md) for the full list of sources and their
licensing.
