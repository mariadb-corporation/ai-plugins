"""Driving the real ``pi`` CLI for the tier-4 e2e test.

How pi has to be wired differs from Claude Code and Codex in ways that are worth
stating, because each one is a way the tier can silently test nothing:

* **A project-local install, honoured only with ``--approve``.** ``pi install -l``
  writes the package into ``.pi/settings.json`` in the current directory, which
  keeps a run hermetic — nothing lands in the user's own pi configuration. But pi
  ignores project-local files unless the run passes ``-a``/``--approve``, so
  without it the package is configured and never loaded. (``pi list`` reads only
  the user settings, so it reports "No packages installed" either way — it is not
  a check that the project-local package is live.)

* **Skills come from the package, as with Codex.** There is no project directory
  pi scans for skills; the repo-root ``package.json`` ``pi`` field is what
  declares them, so installing the repo *is* how the skills reach the model.

* **The provider is whatever pi is configured for**, including a local one. There
  is no API key for this suite to check, which is why the prerequisite gate runs
  a trivial prompt rather than inspecting credentials: ``pi auth check`` reports
  ``not_ready`` even when runs succeed against a working provider.

* **Evidence is the JSONL stream from ``--mode json``**, whose events are
  ``{"type": "message_start"|"message_end"|"message_update", "message": {...}}``.
  Assistant text is assembled from those rather than from the plain-text output.
