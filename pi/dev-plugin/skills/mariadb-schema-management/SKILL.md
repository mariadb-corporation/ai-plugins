# MariaDB Schema Management (MSM) — Overview

The MariaDB Schema Management (MSM) plugin manages a database schema across its
**whole lifecycle** — first creation, every versioned release, and in-place
upgrades — as a **schema project** on disk, driven by the `msm.*` tools of the
**`mariadb-shell` MCP server**. Prefer MSM over a one-off create script whenever
a schema will evolve and be deployed to servers that may hold an older version.
(For a single, non-versioned create script, use `mariadb-schema-create-script`
instead.)

Assume MariaDB 11.8 if not told otherwise. This skill is the map; read the
focused sub-skill for the step you are on.

## The lifecycle

```text
create project + author initial schema   →  mariadb-schema-management-create
        │
        ▼
develop the next version in _next.sql     →  mariadb-schema-management-develop
        │
        ▼
prepare release vX  +  FILL update script  →  mariadb-schema-management-release
   +  generate deployment script
        │
        ▼
deploy vX (create fresh OR upgrade)        →  mariadb-schema-management-deploy
        │
        └──────────────► back to develop (dev version already bumped)
```

> **The one rule everyone gets wrong:** `prepare_release` creates an *empty*
> update script (`releases/updates/<schema>_<prev>_to_<vX>.sql`). You MUST fill
> its migration sections **before** generating the deployment script — the
> deployment script embeds them to upgrade existing installs. See
> `mariadb-schema-management-release`.

## Project layout

`msm.create_project` scaffolds:

```text
<schema>.msm.project/
├── msm.project.json     # schemaName, license, copyrightHolder, schemaDependencies
├── development/
│   ├── <schema>_next.sql            # the working script; version lives in section 910
│   └── sections/                    # optional SOURCE breakout files (see -develop)
└── releases/
    ├── versions/    <schema>_<x.y.z>.sql              # full CREATE snapshot per release
    ├── updates/     <schema>_<x.y.z>_to_<a.b.c>.sql   # per-release migration (fill by hand)
    └── deployment/  <schema>_deployment_<x.y.z>.sql   # generated; create-or-upgrade; never edit
```

Versions use **semantic versioning** (`major.minor.patch`). The development file
carries the `_next` suffix (no version in the name); the version is stored in the
`msm_schema_version` view defined in section 910.

## The MSM section model (shared reference)

MSM scripts are plain SQL split into numbered sections marked by
`-- ##### ... MSM Section NNN: Title` banners. **The section a statement lives in
determines how the deployment script treats it.** Always edit sections with
`msm.get_sql_content_from_section` / `msm.set_section_sql_content` (by
`file_path` + `section_id`) so the banners are never corrupted.

**Create / version script** (author with `-create`, evolve with `-develop`):

| Section | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| 010 | Server-variable save (provided) |
| 110 | `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS` (provided) |
| 120 | Version-creation indicator: `msm_schema_version` = `0,0,0` (provided) |
| 130 | Helper routines used during creation — names must start `msm_` |
| **140** | **Non-idempotent: `CREATE TABLE` + base-data `INSERT`s** |
| **150** | **Idempotent: VIEWs / PROCEDUREs / FUNCTIONs / TRIGGERs / EVENTs** |
| 170 | Authorization: `CREATE ROLE` / `GRANT` |
| 180 | Optional MariaDB REST Service endpoints |
| 190 | Removal of the `msm_` helpers |
| 910 | Final schema version — set via `msm.set_development_version` |
| 920 | Server-variable restore (provided) |

**Update script** (fill during `-release`):

| Section | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| 010 / 220 | Server vars + update indicator `0,0,0` (provided) |
| 230 | Update helper routines (`msm_`) |
| **240** | **Non-idempotent changes + ALL drops: `ALTER TABLE`, new tables, data backfill, `DROP`s that unblock table changes** |
| **250** | **Idempotent re-creation of changed VIEWs / routines / triggers / events** |
| 270 | Authorization changes: `GRANT` / `REVOKE` |
| 290 | Removal of update helpers |
| 910 / 920 | New version + server-variable restore (provided) |

**Idempotent vs. non-idempotent** — the core distinction:
- **Non-idempotent** (140 create / 240 update): `TABLE` structure and data —
  state that cannot be trivially re-run, so it is version-guarded.
- **Idempotent** (150 create / 250 update): everything else — always written with
  `CREATE OR REPLACE` / `DROP ... IF EXISTS` so re-running is safe.

**Delimiter/placement rule** (why the split exists): in the generated deployment
script, sections **140, 240, 170, 270** become the *body of a stored procedure*
— write them as plain `;`-terminated statements, **no `DELIMITER`**, use dynamic
SQL for conditional DDL. Sections **130, 150, 230, 250, 190, 290** are emitted at
top level and use `DELIMITER %%` for routine bodies.

## The `msm.*` MCP tools

- **Project:** `msm.create_project`, `msm.get_project_information`.
- **Sections:** `msm.get_sql_content_from_section`, `msm.set_section_sql_content`.
- **Versions:** `msm.set_development_version`, `msm.get_released_versions`,
  `msm.get_last_released_version`, `msm.get_last_deployment_version`,
  `msm.get_deployment_script_versions`.
- **Release / deploy:** `msm.prepare_release`, `msm.generate_deployment_script`,
  `msm.deploy_schema` (the last needs an open `db.connect` connection).
